"<h3>Overview</h3> <p>Some members have been sent an email with the subject "
"<strong>Action Required: Confirm Your Groups.io Membership to Continue Receiving "
"Group Emails</strong>. It asks the member to either respond to the email or log "
"into their account in order to confirm their membership. Most such accounts are "
"ones that haven't posted in a long time. It's important that all know that "
"<strong>this email is legit</strong>. It's not a phish.</p> <p>Any user who got "
"the email and does not complete the confirmation/reverification by Mon March 25 "
"2024 will be suspended from Groups.io. A few follow-on emails will be sent to "
"non-responding members between now and Mon March 25 2024.</p> <div class=\"well "
"well-sm\"> If you are an owner or moderator of a group, you can see if any of "
"your members need to be reverified. Go to the Members page of your group, and "
"look for the <span class=\"label label-info\">RI</span> badge. You may not have "
"any members with that badge. If so, <strong>you can safely ignore this</strong>. "
"</div> <h3>Why Reverification?</h3> <p>On March 11, 2024, an anti-spam service "
"called Spamhaus labeled one of our email servers as a spam sender. This caused "
"any email service that uses Spamhaus to stop accepting email from our server. "
"The reason they labeled one of our email servers as a spam sender is because "
"some groups have email addresses subscribed that are not valid people, but are "
"instead spam traps. A spam trap is an email address that is not used by a "
"person, but is instead used to catch spammers. That is the reason that we began "
"a reverification process and sent out reverification emails to many users on "
"that day.</p> <p>We recognize and apologize for the inconvenience this may "
"cause, but we are required to do this in order to ensure that group email "
"delivery will be able to continue unencumbered.</p> <h3>Example Of The "
"Reverification Email</h3> <div class=\"well well-sm\"> "
"<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Action Required: Confirm Your Groups.io Membership "
"to Continue Receiving Group Emails</p> <p>Hello,</p> <p>Your account associated "
"with EMAIL ADDRESS has been a member of one or more Groups.io email groups since "
"DATE. As part of our commitment to maintain a valuable and spam-free experience, "
"we're updating our subscription records. To ensure you still wish to receive "
"emails from your subscribed groups, we kindly ask for your confirmation.</p> "
"<p>You have two simple options to confirm your subscription:</p> <p> 1. Without "
"adding any text, just send a reply to this email. This will be seen by the "
"software at groups.io as a wish to stay in your groups. <br> 2. Or you can log "
"into your Groups.io account and your active login will count as "
"confirmation.</p> <p>If we don't hear from you, we will send a reminder email "
"every 4 days to ensure you have every opportunity to remain subscribed.</p> "
"<p>Without confirmation by Mon Mar 25 2024, we will take it as an indication "
"that you prefer not to continue your subscriptions. Consequently, your email "
"will be removed from the groups you are a member of.</p> <p>We have put together "
"a FAQ page with more information. You can find it here: <a "
"href=\"https://groups.io/static/reverifyfaq\">https://groups.io/static/reverifyfaq</a></p> "
"<p>You are a member of the following groups hosted by us: <ul> <li>GROUPNAME - "
"Group Description</li> </ul> <p> <p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this "
"matter and for being an essential part of our community.</p> <br> Best Regards "
"<br> The Groups.io Team </div> <h3>If You Have Received A Reverification "
"Email</h3> <p>Members who received the reverification email have through Monday, "
"March 25 2024 to either reply to the email or log into their Groups.io "
"account.</p> <p>If you reply to the email, you do not need to enter anything in "
"the reply. You will be sent an acknowledgement email.</p> <p>If you log into "
"your account, you will see a green banner saying you've successfully reverified. "
"You do not need to do anything else. If you don't have a password or don't "
"remember your password, use the <i>Forgot your password, or don't have one "
"yet?</i> link to have an email sent to you with a link that will log you in "
"automatically. Once you log in, you will be reverified.</p> <p>We will send "
"additional reverification reminders until Mon March 25 2024. For members that "
"are removed after this process, the removals will be logged in the group's "
"Activity Log.</p> <h3>Moderators</h3> <p>You can see which your users are "
"affected. Go to the Admin section of your group and look at the Members page. "
"Next to each user's email, there may be a badge with the letters <span "
"class=\"label label-info\">RI</span> or <span class=\"label "
"label-info\">RS</span>. <span class=\"label label-info\">RI</span> means the "
"confirmation/reverification is in progress (but has not been completed). <span "
"class=\"label label-info\">RS</span> means the confirmation/reverification has "
"been successfully completed.</p> <p>Moderators can download a filtered CSV "
"formatted list of members, by clicking the <strong>Download</strong> button "
"after checking the appropriate Filter checkboxes.</p> <p>The number of members "
"affected varies widely from group to group; some have none. Overall, it's only a "
"fraction of the total Groups.io membership.</p> <h3>Timeline (still being "
"finalized)</h3> <p>Here are the remaining steps in the process:</p> <ol> <li>For "
"at least an additional two weeks after March 25th, people will still be able to "
"reverify themselves and the <span class=\"label label-info\">RI</span> and <span "
"class=\"label label-info\">RS</span> badges will still show up in the Members "
"page.</li> <li>After that, members still in the <span class=\"label "
"label-info\">RI</span> state will be removed from groups. The activity log entry "
"will be <em>Membership - Member Removed</em>, with the added reason of "
"<em>reverification failed</em>.</li> </ol> <p>For domains where no "
"reverifications happened, accounts will be banned from all activity with the "
"thought that they are potential spam traps. Those email addresses cannot login, "
"re-join groups by invitation, direct addition, or request to join. If there is a "
"valid person on one of those domains, they should contact support@groups.io to "
"have the domain ban lifted. For domains without such a ban, the user's account "
"will remain, so users removed from their groups can log in directly or by using "
"the \"Email me a link to log in\" button on the login page. This will re-verify "
"their account. They can then request to join groups or be added via direct "
"addition or invitation. </p>"

"A subgroup is a group within another group. Subgroups have all the functionality "

"first be a member of the primary (parent) group. Also, subgroups are not listed "
"in the public directory of groups. You can use subgroups for subsets of your "
"primary group's membership. For example, an organization could use a subgroup "
"for its board of directors or use several subgroups for different committees. Or "
"you could create subgroups for different subject areas that are related to your "
"primary group. The GroupManagersForum wiki contains additional information on "
"why one might want to use subgroups. One reason to use subgroups is that their "
"email and web addresses have a common identity with those of the primary group. "
"Subgroups may be listed on the primary group's home page; each subgroup has a "
"Privacy setting to control this. A link back to the primary group is "
"automatically placed on the subgroups' home pages. Subgroups cannot have "
"subgroups of their own, only the primary group may have subgroups. The flip side "
"of this, and a reason not to use a subgroup, is that subgroups are not listed in "
"Groups.io's directory of public groups. If the subject of the new group stands "
"on its own it may be better to create a separate group rather than a subgroup."
